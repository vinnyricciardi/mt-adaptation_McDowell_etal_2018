# Project: Adaptation action and research in glaciated mountain systems

This repo is for the systematic review article, 'Adaptation action and research in glaciated mountain  systems: Are they enough to meet the challenge of climate change?'



Full article details will be available when published:

In short, we systematically searched academic and grey literature databases to preform a review of mountain adaptation literature. We then combined our reviewed material with geocoded study locations to make an [interactive mapping platform](https://mtn-adaptation.shinyapps.io/mcdowell_etal_2018/) for users to explore the dataset and findings.

RShiny and leaflet was used to create this app along with a cutom bootstrap.css.

All geocoding was done through the Google Maps API using Python.

For replicability, we have included the dataset used for the RShiny app. The full systemaitc review dataset will be released with the article; this dataset feeds into the majority of Python notebooks.
