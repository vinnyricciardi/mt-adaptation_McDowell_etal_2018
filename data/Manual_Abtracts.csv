StudyTitle,Abstract_manualClimate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management in Agriculture - Priority Framework for Action 2011-2020,"A comprehensive priority framework to support and provide strategic direction to the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, its technical services and agencies for the implementation of Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) priorities in Agriculture and allied sectors in Nepal."National Institutional Assessment on the Integration of Disaster Risk Management(DRM) into the Agriculture Sector of Pakistan,"Agriculture, the mainstay of Pakistan's economy, is very exposed to extreme weather events with the impacts of climate change. Based on the floods and droughts experienced in recent years, it is evident that a strong commitment to enhancing the resilience of the agriculture sector is urgently needed. This will require increased investment, improved governance, and considerable work on policies and strategies at the national and sub-national levels. Before we can successfully integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRR/M) into the agricultural sector, it is essential to study and attempt to mitigate the existing vulnerabilities and sensitivities. We must endeavour to promote climate smart agriculture and early warning systems. We require inclusive training programs for institutional capacity building at different levels, with clear roles and responsibilities, and context specific technical knowledge of DRM measures. The underpinning element that spells success for these measures is community based disaster risk management."Cultivating Ice over time: On the Idea of timeless knowledge and places in the himalayas,"Assumptions that local communities have an endogenous capacity to adapt to climate change stemming from time-tested knowledge and an inherent sense of community that prompts mobilisation are becoming increasingly common in material produced by international organisations. This discourse, which relies on ahistorical and apolitical conceptions of localities and populations, is based on ideas of timeless knowledge and places. Analysing the water-place nexus in Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas, through a close study of glacier practices as they change over time, the article argues that local knowledge is subject to change and must be analysed in light of changing conceptions and experiences of place by the state and by local populations alike."Raising Awareness of the Impacts of Climate Change: Initial Steps in Shaping Policy in Nepal,"Climate change is happening and people have begun to feel its impacts on their daily lives. Clear indications of these impacts can be seen on Himalayan glaciers, which are melting at rapid rates and consequently form massive glacial lakes (Figure 1), with a risk of catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs result in loss of lives, property, and costly infrastructure, as well as displacement of local people. They represent a particular threat in Nepal, where resources are already scarce. In least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal, where poverty reduction is a national priority, the impact of climate change appears to be an obstacle to the process of sustainable development. Institutionalizing the climate change issue in national policies has now become an urgent need rather than a choice. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Nepal has agreed to take climate change considerations into account in its national development agenda. The first step was the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; the second is building the necessary institutional services such as a Designated National Authority (DNA), which is in the process of establishment. Moreover, climate change policies and strategies, the interconnections between different sectors, and coordination among different line ministries and government departments are issues to be addressed in the near future. WWF has initiated a Climate Witness Project to raise national and international awareness, and supports national efforts to shape adequate institutional responses to climate change."Agricultural development under a changing climate : opportunities and challenges for adaptation,"Climate change presents a profound challenge to food security and development. Negative impacts from climate change are likely to be greatest in regions that are currently food insecure and may even be significant in those regions that have made large gains in reducing food insecurity over the past half-century. Adaptation in the agricultural sector is being given a high priority within this effort because of the inherent sensitivity of food production to climate and the strong inter-linkages that exist between climate, agriculture, and economic growth and development. The purpose of this report is to review the major effects of climate change on the agricultural sector; to examine the causes of vulnerability; and to suggest a range of potential options and investment opportunities for supporting adaptation efforts and, more generally, for building adaptive capacity. This report primarily focuses on appropriate strategies for adapting to climate change impacts that are projected to occur over the next one to two decades, although several issues covered in this report are important for long-term adaptation needs as well. This report also describes opportunities for linking adaptation and mitigation, and it discusses the importance of mainstreaming adaptation into development."Assessing the potential consequences of climate destabilization in Latin America,"Estimating the potential costs of climate destabilization is not a trivial matter. Potential climate impacts have multiple consequences, some of which can be monetized while others are beyond the reach of standard economic tools. A full assessment of the implications of climate impacts often cannot be completed because many of the consequences are only partly known. This report summarizes data recently made available, through the portfolio of adaptation activities in the region, on some of the damages induced by climate destabilization. These include impacts from hurricane intensification, glacier retreat, and increased exposure to tropical vector diseases, coral bleaching, and composite costs of climate change in the particularly vulnerable Caribbean Basin. Other costs are becoming evident but they still cannot be estimated. Most worrisome among these are the potential implications from Amazon dieback which, if realized, will drastically affect the water cycle in the region as well as environmental services essential to economic activity in the region, with wider global implications. The report refers to destabilization in the title as recognition, that the region is now facing impacts from major, destabilizing changes in its climate.""Mountain Forests in a Changing World: Realizing values, addressing challenges","Forests play a key role in mountain areas, providing goods and services essential to the livelihood of both highland and lowland communities. Freshwater streaming down from mountains is accessible to more than half of the world's population and available for the most varied needs, such as drinking, cooking and washing, farming, hydropower, industry and transportation. The biodiversity stored in healthy mountain forests provides a range of products, such as timber, fuel, medicinal and aromatic plants, fodder and a wide variety of foods that ensure the well-being of local populations. Mountain forests also occupy a crucial position in terms of climate change, representing fundamental ecosystems for the health of the planet. This publication is intended to raise awareness of the global importance and the need for sustainable management of these unique ecosystems. It was prepared in 2011, to coincide with the world's celebration of the International Year of Forests as well as of the International Mountain Day on December 11th, dedicated to the theme of mountain forests. To mark these occasions, the Mountain Partnership Secretariat at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) have jointly issued this volume, the fourth of a series, including Mountains and Climate Change, Mountain Biodiversity and Global Change, and Highlands and Drylands. Hoping that, through this publication, communities, scientists and policy makers at national and international level will support the creation and implementation of long-term policies in order to conserve and protect these fundamental ecosystems and to benefit and improve the lives of their people for the benefit of both mountain people and inhabitants of adjacent lowlands.""Evolution of Access Routes to High Mountain Refuges of the Mer de Glace Basin (Mont Blanc Massif, France)","Glacial shrinkage and the gravitational processes associated with it, which are characteristic of global warming effects in high mountain environments, are affecting mountaineering routes more and more, including access routes to high altitude refuges. These changes have almost never been studied. Also, this research seeks to identify and explain the evolution of access trails to five refuges, located in the Mer de Glace basin (Mont Blanc massif), over more than a century. This glacier is the largest in France (L = 11.5 km, SA = 30 km2) is a major Alpine tourist attraction since 1741 and is the birthplace of mountaineering. This work is based on a three-step methodology: 1) collection and analysis of maps, climbing guidebooks and photographs, 2) semi-structured interviews and 3) analysis of high-resolution digital terrain models obtained through terrestrial laser scanning. While there was not a significant evolution during most of the 20th century, glacier thickness loss and the associated erosion of lateral moraines have resulted in numerous modifications made to the access trails since the 1990s. Despite these adaptations, the danger they pose continues to rise, and the necessity to equip them is ever more important (633 m. of ladders at present), which raises doubts about the future accessibility of such high mountain refuges."Convenient solutions to an inconvenient truth: ecosystem-based approaches to climate change,"Global warming and changes in climate have already had observed impacts on natural ecosystems and species. Natural systems such as wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs, cloud forests, and Arctic and high-latitude ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate-induced disturbances. However, enhanced protection and management of biological resources and habitats can mitigate the impacts and contribute to solutions as nations and communities strive to adapt to climate change. Biodiversity is the foundation and mainstay of agriculture, forests, and fisheries. Biological resources provide the raw materials for livelihoods, agriculture, medicines, trade, tourism, and industry. Forests, grasslands, freshwater, and marine and other natural ecosystems provide a range of services often not recognized in national economic accounts but vital to human welfare: regulation of water flows and water quality, flood control, pollination, decontamination, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, and nutrient and hydrological cycling. Current efforts to address climate change focus mainly on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by adopting cleaner energy strategies and on reducing the vulnerability of communities at risk by improving infrastructure to meet new energy and water needs. This book offers a compelling argument for including ecosystem-based approaches to mitigation and adaptation as an essential pillar in national strategies to address climate change. Such ecosystem-based strategies can offer cost-effective, proven, and sustainable solutions that contribute to, and complement, other national and regional adaptation strategies."Robust Decision-Making in the Water Sector: A Strategy for Implementing Limaâ€™s Long-Term Water Resources Master PlanÂ ,"How can water resource agencies make smart investments to ensure long-term water reliability when the future is fraught with deep climate and economic uncertainty? This study helped SEDAPAL, the water utility serving Lima, Peru, answer this question by drawing on state of the art methods for decision making under deep uncertainty. These methods provide techniques for evaluating the performance of a water system over a wide range of plausible futures and then developing strategies that are robust across these futures. Rather than weighting futures probabilistically to define an optimal strategy, these methodologies identify the vulnerabilities of a system and then evaluate the key trade-offs among different adaptive strategies. Through extensive iteration and collaboration with SEDAPAL, the study used these methods to define an investment strategy that is robust, ensuring water reliability across as wide a range of future conditions as possible while also being economically efficient. First,on completion, the study helped SEDAPAL realize that not all projects included in the Master Plan were necessary to achieve water reliability, and the utility could save 25 percent (more than $600 million) in investment costs. Second, the study helped focus future efforts on demand-side management, pricing, and soft infrastructure, a refocusing that is difficult to achieve in traditional utility companies. Third, the study helped SEDAPAL gain the support of regulatory and budget agencies through the careful analysis of alternatives. Fourth, the study allowed the utility to postpone lower priority investments, and to analyze future options based on climate and demand information that simply is not available now."Reducing the vulnerability of Georgia's agricultural systems to climate change: Impact assessment and adaptation options,"In countries such as Georgia, the risks of climate change for the agricultural sector are a particularly immediate and important problem because the majority of the rural population depends either directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. The most effective plans for adapting the sector to climate change will involve both human capital and physical capital enhancements; however, many of these investments can also enhance agricultural productivity right now, under current climate conditions. Recommendations, such as improving the accessibility to farmers of agriculturally relevant weather forecasts, will yield benefits as soon as they are implemented and provide a means for farmers to autonomously adapt their practices as climate changes. In response to these challenges, the World Bank and the Government of Georgia embarked on a joint study to identify and prioritize options for climate change adaptation of the agricultural sector, with explicit consideration of greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of these options. The study was conducted in three stages: awareness raising; quantitative and qualitative analysis; and finalization of the analysis and menu of adaptation options. This report provides a menu of options for climate change adaptation in the agricultural and water resources sectors, along with specific recommended actions that are tailored to distinct agricultural regions within Georgia. This report provides a summary of the methods, data, results, and recommendations for each of these activities, which were reviewed by local counterparts at the October 8, 2012, national dissemination and consensus building conference."Understanding Mountain Soils: A Contribution from mountain areas to the International Year of Soils 2016,"In every mountain region, soils constitute the foundation for agriculture, supporting essential ecosystem functions and food security. Mountain soils benefit not only the 900 million people living in the world’s mountainous areas but also billions more living downstream. Soil is a fragile resource that needs time to regenerate. Mountain soils are particularly susceptible to climate change, deforestation, unsustainable farming practices and resource extraction methods that affect their fertility and trigger land degradation, desertification and disasters such as floods and landslides. Mountain peoples often have a deep-rooted connection to the soils they live on; it is a part of their heritage. Over the centuries, they have developed solutions and techniques, indigenous practices, knowledge and sustainable soil management approaches which have proved to be a key to resilience. This publication, produced by the Mountain Partnership as a contribution to the International Year of Soils 2015, presents the main features of mountain soil systems, their environmental, economic and social values, the threats they are facing and the cultural traditions concerning them. Case studies provided by Mountain Partnership members and partners around the world showcase challenges and opportunities as well as lessons learned in soil management. This publication presents a series of lessons learned and recommendations to inform mountain communities, policy-makers, development experts and academics who support sustainable mountain development."The Himalayan Ice Stupa Ladakh's Climate-adaptive Water Cache,"In Ladakh, northern India, the recent development of an ice stupa suggests a new model for climate-adaptive design thinking. Here, the region's shrinking supply of glacial meltwater has led to the creation of a novel water management strategy, in which community involvement, ecological awareness, and religious iconography have been harnessed to make the most of a diminishing natural resource. Beyond simply providing a water cache for agricultural use, the ice stupas of Ladakh reveal a sophisticated response to social, environmental, and cultural constraints. In so doing, the project provides a working model for water husbandry in northern India and valuable insight into the emerging practice of designing for climate change."Indigenous peoples and climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Indigenous peoples across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) already perceive and experience negative effects of climate change and variability. Although the overall economic impact of climate change on gross domestic product (GDP) is significant, what is particularly problematic is that it falls disproportionately on the poor including indigenous peoples, who constitute about 6.5 percent of the population in the region and are among its poorest and most vulnerable (Hall and Patrinos 2006). This book examines the social implications of climate change and climatic variability for indigenous communities in LAC and the options for improving their resilience and adaptability to these phenomena. By social implications, the authors mean direct and indirect effects in the broad sense of the word social, including factors contributing to human well-being, health, livelihoods, human agency, social organization, and social justice. This book, much of which relies on new empirical research, addresses specifically the situation of indigenous communities because our research showed them to be among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. A companion book (Verner 2010) provides information on the broader social dimensions of climate change in LAC and on policy options for addressing them. This book will help to place these impacts higher on the climate-change agenda and guide efforts to enhance indigenous peoples' rights and opportunities, whether by governments, indigenous peoples' organizations and their leaders, or non-state representatives."How small communities respond to environmental change: patterns from tropical to polar ecosystems,"Local communities throughout the world are experiencing extensive social, cultural, economic, environmental, and climatic changes. Rather than passively accepting the effects of such changes, many communities are responding in various ways to take advantage of opportunities and to minimize negative impacts. We review examples from 13 cases around the world to identify patterns in how communities have been able to respond to change. Communities are able to respond by making changes in the time and location of activities, by using different species, by developing or using new technologies, and by organizing themselves internally or in networks. The possible responses a community can make on its own constitute the autonomous response space. When communities work with others to respond, they are in the collaborative response space. These findings suggest that assessments concerning climate and other forms of change should include local responses as a foundation for policy recommendations, recognizing that both autonomous and collaborative responses can contribute to adaptation. Policies designed to achieve adaptation or sustainability should consider ways to expand the autonomous response space, thus freeing local initiative, while also making the collaborative response space more cooperative, thus providing support to communities rather than imposing limitations."Mountain Farming Is Family Farming,"Mountain farming is largely family farming. Thanks to its small-scale character, diversification of crops, integration of forests and husbandry activities, and low carbon footprint, mountain agriculture has evolved over the centuries in an often harsh and difficult environment and contributed to sustainable development. Cultivating mountain areas, with their patches of useable land dispersed at different altitudes, with many different climates and limited use for mechanization, is most effectively carried out by family farms. Family farming in mountains is as diverse as the myriad mountain landscapes of the world, but at the same time, there are also commonalities."The Impact of glacier retreat in the Andes: international multidisciplinary network for adaptation strategies,"Overview of the challenges of the impact of glacier retreat in the Andes, and the activities of the International Hydrological Programme of UNESCO through an international multidisciplinary network to identify vulnerabilities, policy needs as well as adaptation strategies."Managing climate risks and adapting to climate change in the agriculture sector in Nepal,"Projected future scenarios of climate suggest that climatic conditions in Nepal will worsen, which may imply even more frequent occurrences of climate-related extremes and negative impacts on food production. However, by adopting the right measures, it is possible to manage the climate risks and adapt to the challenges posed by increasing climate variability and climate change. Efforts to promote such measures require a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening the capacities of institutions and delivering needbased services to farming communities. This report provides detailed information about climate and its variability in Nepal, including past trends, future climate change projections and likely impacts on the agriculture sector. The report elaborates the institutional context for managing climate risks and adaptation and reiterates the need to strengthen the collection and analysis of data and information. A comprehensive typology of coping and adaptation strategies for managing current climate risks and building the necessary knowledge and good practices for advancing adaptation over the longer term is presented. The report also examines the issues and opportunities for mainstreaming climate change concerns into broader agriculture and food security policies, plans and strategies."Restoration of overgrazed pÃ¡ramo grasslands for hydrological benefits,"The paramo  is a mountain ecosystem in the Andean tropics situated above the tree line andbelow glaciers. It is dominated by grasslands on soils with high organic carbon content.  Peat ispresent in these areas but not everywhere, only on the flatter areas.  The slopes are covered withandosols. The ecosystem is crucial for supplying water for agriculture in inter-Andean valleys,hydropower and high-altitude cities. The city of Quito started to withdraw its water from the Andes’Eastern Cordillera in the 1970s. Most of the catchment areas were placed under the protectionof National Parks. However, some areas remained in hands of families that had owned themfor centuries and hold large herds of sheep and cattle. The Quito water supply company boughtrecently two properties (8000 ha each) at the headwaters of tributaries that fed two distinct watersupply systems. Each of the properties has a centuries–long  history of overgrazing. All sheep andcattle were removed from the properties, which reduced the livestock load to some horses andoccasional visits of neighbouring cattle.This project exclusively concerns the conservation and restoration of water–related environmentalservices. Carbon sequestration or GHG effects are secondary. As there is not yet a large bodyof experience on  páramo  restoration, around 20 pilot and demonstration plots were set upto test different techniques, including simple fencing and the transplantation of plants fromwell–conserved nearby  areas. A monitoring framework was also put into place to measure thehydrological benefits of the restoration activities on the future water supply.""Climate change, water and food security","The impacts of climate change on the global hydrological cycle are expected to vary the patterns of demand and supply of water for agriculture – the dominant user of freshwater. The extent and productivity of both irrigated and rainfed agriculture can be expected to change. As a result, the livelihoods of rural communities and the food security of a predominantly urban population are at risk from water-related impacts linked primarily to climate variability. The rural poor, who are the most vulnerable, are likely to be disproportionately affected. Adaptation measures that build upon improved land and water management practices will be fundamental in boosting overall resilience to climate change. And this is not just to maintain food security: the continued integrity of land and water systems is essential for all economic uses of water. This report summarizes current knowledge of the anticipated impacts of climate change on water availability for agriculture and examines the implications for local and national food security. It analyses expected impact of climate change on a set of major agricultural systems at risk and makes the case for immediate implementation of ‘no-regrets’ strategies which have both positive development outcomes and make agricultural systems resilient. It is hoped that policy makers and planners can use this report to frame their adaptation responses when considering both the water variable in agriculture and the competing demands from other users. "Overcoming institutional and governance challenges in environmental management: case studies from Latin America and the Caribbean region,"The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region has a unique mix of qualities and challenges when it comes to the environment. It is exceptionally endowed with natural assets, with globally significant biodiversity and valuable crops, and also harbors the worlds greatest carbon sink in the Amazon. The purpose of the series is to contribute to the global knowledge exchange on innovation in environmental and water resources management and the pursuit of greener and more inclusive growth. The series addresses issues relevant to the regions environmental sustainability agenda from water resources management to environmental health, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, environmental policy, pollution management, environmental institutions and governance, ecosystem services, environmental financing, irrigation and climate change and their linkages to development and growth. The author presents three successful case studies. The first case study describes how Colombia designed and implemented an air quality management program based on public awareness, evidence-based policy design, and political commitment to reform. The second case study examines how Brazil is promoting access to environmental justice through the public prosecutors model. A third case study shows how the modeling of climate change and monitoring of glacial retreat in the Andean countries is fostering decision making to address the increasingly important challenge of climate change adaptation."Transitioning to climate resilient development: perspectives from communities in Peru,"The livelihoods of communities in rural areas of Peru are predominantly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture. Given their close connection with the environment, the understanding of how these communities perceive risks and how they adapt to and cope with climate hazards is important for identifying entry points for efforts aimed at building resilience. In this context, it is assumed that the successful use of climate information will depend on appropriate information formats that fit the decision-making structure of communities as stakeholders and also have their trust. In connection with collecting information of community knowledge on environmental predictors of weather and climatic conditions and recommendations for capacity-building needs, it is hoped that the report will provide valuable, initial guidance on which elements play an important role in strengthening the adaptive capacity of communities to climate variability and change. The objective of part one is to place climate variability and change into the broader development of Peru and outline risk management structures. This overview will then be contrasted with the perceptions of risks and vulnerabilities and coping and adaptation strategies at the community level described in part two for Northwestern Peru and the altiplano, which are regions considered highly vulnerable to climate-related hazards. The report concludes by developing a set of overarching and locale-specific recommendations."Assessment of the impacts of climate change on mountain hydrology : development of a methodology through a case study in Peru,"The objective of the study is to develop a methodology to assess the net impacts of climate change on mountain hydrology. The development of this methodology will allow planners and policy makers to better plan for adaptation measures to address the climate change impacts on the power and water supply sectors. This report presents the methodology used to assess impacts of climate change on mountain hydrology in Peru, and some of the results obtained from employing this methodology. Chapter two presents the method and results of the climate projections (climate analysis). Chapter three presents the hydrologic model (WEAP) and describes how it is modified to take into account the complex mountain hydrological system (hydrology analysis). In chapter four the results of the climate analysis are fed into the modified hydrologic tool to assess future hydrology conditions in selected basins in Peru. Finally, chapter five presents the main conclusions of the study."The social dimensions of adaptation of climate change in Bolivia,"The study in Bolivia was based on the concepts contained in the document methodology for the social component (October 2008) prepared by the core team in Washington. These lists the social component objectives as: to develop a methodology for estimating the costs of adaptation strategies at the local level; to identify how public adaptation policies can benefit the most vulnerable members of society; to identify how factors such as socio-economic status, gender and poverty impact on vulnerability to climate change; and to ascertain local perceptions of the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation in different agro-ecological zones. The study was conducted in four phases: 1) preparation: the main objective of the first phase is to collect qualitative, quantitative, and illustrative secondary data related to climate change and to analyze previous studies undertaken in Bolivia on climate change adaptation; 2) sampling: the second phase, which lasted one month, primarily consisted of constructing a climate vulnerability zoning pattern of the entire country to serve as a basis for identifying and selecting areas for study; 3) field work: the field work was undertaken over a period of three months, consisting of three activities: a) designing tools for field work; b) identification, recruitment and training of researchers; and c) information collection in the field through interviews and workshops; and 4) reports: the final phase involved processing and analyzing the information and drafting the final report."Reducing vulnerability to climate change in the Swiss Alps: a study of adaptive planning,"The Swiss Alps will experience pronounced effects of climate change due to the combination of their latitudinal positioning, altitude and unique ecosystems, placing socio-economic stresses on alpine communities, many of which rely on seasonal tourism. Studies into tourism adaptation within the Swiss Alps have so far focused on the technical adaptation options of alpine stakeholders, rather than perceptions of adaptation to climate change at the operational and community level. This article investigates attitudes to adaptation in two alpine regions within Switzerland's well-established decentralized political framework, through semi-structured qualitative interviews. Stakeholders focused almost entirely on maintaining the status quo of winter tourism, through technical or marketing measures, with mixed attitudes towards climatic impacts. A matrix based on the relative internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats of adaptation measures (a SWOT framework) was used to assess the measures and suggest how stakeholders could capitalize on the new opportunities thrown up by climate change to create a competitive advantage. A comprehensive and collaborative planning approach is vital to enable policy makers and stakeholders to maximize opportunities, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on the local economy, and develop inclusive adaptation measures that benefit the entire region in order to create more sustainable social, economic and environmental structures."Synergies between climate mitigation and adaptation in forest landscape restoration,"The two responses to climate change - mitigating emissions and adapting to impacts - are often pursued as separate actions. But some ecosystem-based responses, like forest landscape restoration, can serve as both mitigation and adaptation tools. A new report from IUCN examines where and how restoration can serve mitigation and adaptation goals across the world and in key countries.""Promoting science-based, community-driven approaches to climate change adaptation in glaciated mountain ranges: HiMAP","This article in the journal Geography explains the work of the USAID-funded High Mountains Adaptation Partnership (HiMAP) project in Nepal from its formation in 2012 up to August 2014. HiMAP aims to create the conditions necessary for communities who live in or are dependent upon glacial watersheds to become more resilient to the impacts of climate change. The project area included the Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) National Park and buffer zone in Khumbu. It notes that such glacier-dominated areas will pose unique challenges to highland and downstream communities as they adapt to climate change, particularly given the threats of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The article, with graphics and illustrations, discusses the impacts of climate change on glaciers in Nepal; previous research on glaciers in Peru and how their experience in reducing flood risks could be applied; and explains how field work and other parts of the HiMAP program has been carried out. This included developing the Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) process with various communities.In Khombu, six priority climate-induced hazards were identified and ranked in order of importance. These are: GLOFs, landslides, heavy snowfall, windstorms, forest fires and floods.  HiMAP helped identify adaptation activites to address each."Bolivia - Country note on climate change aspects in agriculture,"This country note briefly summarizes information relevant to both climate change and agriculture in Bolivia, with focus on policy developments (including action plans and programs) and institutional make-up. Like most countries in Latin America, Bolivia has submitted one national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with a second one under preparation. Land use change and forestry, coupled with agriculture, are by far the largest contributors to green house gas (GHG) emissions in the country. The emission reduction potential of the sector is large, but not sufficiently explored. Bolivia counts with only two registered Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, none of which is in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate variability and weather extremes and around a third of the population derives their livelihood from agricultural production. A greater emphasis on adaptation strategies, in particular those related to water harvest and sustainable land management, as well as developing and applying adequate insurance mechanisms can be placed for better management of public resources in light of natural disasters in the agriculture sector."Chile - Country note on climate change aspects in agriculture,"This country note briefly summarizes information relevant to both climate change and agriculture in Chile, with focus on policy developments (including action plans and programs) and institutional make-up. Like most countries in Latin America, Chile has submitted one national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with a second one under preparation. Agriculture contributes little, in relative terms, to total green house gas (GHG) emissions and the mitigation potential in the sector is mainly related to afforestation and the sustainable management of native forests. Agriculture is highly vulnerable to weather extremes, in particular in the central parts of the country, where water scarcity is an issue. Desertification and soil erosion are some of the other major problems facing the country, though measures for reducing erosion are yielding positive results. A greater emphasis on developing and applying adequate insurance mechanisms can be placed for better management of public resources in light of natural disasters in the agriculture sector."Ecuador - Country note on climate change aspects in agriculture,"This country note briefly summarizes information relevant to both climate change and agriculture in Ecuador, with focus on policy developments (including action plans and programs) and institutional make-up. Like most countries in Latin America, Ecuador has submitted one national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with a second one under preparation. Land use change and forestry are the largest contributors to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in the country. The emission reduction potential of the agricultural sector (including land use change and forestry) is significant and not yet sufficiently explored in the country. Agriculture is highly vulnerable to weather variability. Sustainable water management and climate-sensitive insurance coverage for agricultural production can reduce some of the observed vulnerabilities in the country."Azerbaijan - Climate change and agriculture country note,"This country note for Azerbaijan is part of a series of country briefs that summarize information relevant to climate change and agriculture for three countries in the Southern Caucasus Region, with a particular focus on climate and crop projections, adaptation and mitigation options, policy development and institutional involvement. The note series has been developed to provide a baseline of knowledge on climate change and agriculture for the countries participating in the regional program on reducing vulnerability to climate change in Southern Caucasus agricultural systems. This note for Azerbaijan was shared with the Government and other agricultural sector stakeholders and used as an engagement tool for a National Awareness Raising and Consultation Workshop, held in Baku in March 2012.

Finally, the note assesses national policy and institutional context related to climate change as well as suggests potential ways forward that can help the Kyrgyz Republic mainstream climate considerations into development activities and planning and create public demand for climate actions. "Uzbekistan - Overview of climate change activities,"This overview of climate change activities in Uzbekistan is part of a series of country notes for five Central Asian countries that summarize climate portfolio in a number of sectors, namely agriculture, forestry and natural resources, water, health, energy, and transport. The note further provides a brief overview of Uzbekistan's climate context in terms of observed impacts and historical trends as well as climate projections specific to sectors that are considered to be essential to the country's economic development. Finally, the note assesses national policy and institutional context related to climate change as well as suggests potential ways forward that could help Uzbekistan mainstream climate considerations into development activities and planning and create public demand for climate actions."Adapting to climate change: assessing the World Bank Group experience - phase three of the World Bank Group and climate change,"This paper constitutes the third and final volume of a series of assessments of the World Bank Group's engagement with climate change issues. The first focused on World Bank involvement in policy issues related to greenhouse gas mitigation. It was mainly concerned with the potential for energy price reform and energy efficiency policies to yield dividends in growth, fiscal savings, and climate change mitigation. The second volume examined project-level lessons related to greenhouse gas mitigation. This volume draws lessons from World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) engagement in climate change adaptation. Like its predecessors, but to an even greater extent, this evaluation has a strong focus on learning, as the Bank Group explores a newly defined agenda. Climate change adaptation has only recently captured widespread policy attention. In strong contrast to climate mitigation, whose progress can be tracked along a single global metric (the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases), adaptation takes many forms, is intensely local, and resists easy definition and measurement. To a much greater extent even than climate change mitigation, adaptation is intertwined with development. Thus this evaluation looks not only at activities explicitly labeled 'climate adaptation' but also at a selection of those that might be expected to be adaptive, even if not so labeled.""Highlands and Drylands: Mountains, a source of resilience in arid regions","This publication has three main objectives: (i) to provide an overall vision of the ecological, social and cultural features of dryland mountain socio-ecosystems, highlighting those processes and elements which have determined their resilience to past and present disturbances, describing current and future impacts, and offering a perspective on conservation and sustainable development based on successful examples from all regions of the world; (ii) to demonstrate the importance of investing human and financial resources in dryland mountains in the framework of the global effort to limit the impact of global change on the livelihoods of human societies and on the natural and cultural wealth of our planet; and (iii) to raise the awareness of development experts, donors and policy and decision makers about the relevance, extent, main challenges, solutions and good practices developed to address desertification and development issues in dryland mountain ecosystems worldwide.""Making the case for ecosystem-based adaptation : the global mountain EbA programme in Nepal, Peru and Uganda","This publication is a legacy document of the Mountain EbA Programme, delivered through a partnership between the German Government, UNEP,  UNDP and IUCN, together with the Governments of Nepal, Peru and Uganda. The objective of the Programme was to strengthen the capacities of these countries to promote EbA options to build ecosystem resilience and to reduce the vulnerability of communities, with particular emphasis on mountain ecosystems. The publication focuses on showcasing and capturing lessons learned on the process of making the case to government and other stakeholders for EbA to be included in broader adaptation strategies, and for the policy and finance shifts needed to bring this about."UNDP Community Water Initiative: Fostering Water Security,"This report aims to provide in-depth information on the UNDP Community Water Initiative, which has funded successful projects in some of the most vulnerable communities in Africa, South Asia, and Central America. This report also highlights some country case studies and activities that provide current water security and community development benefits."Vulnerability to climate change in agricultural systems in Latin America and the Caribbean - building response strategies: final report,"This report describes a bottom-up approach to identifying and prioritizing agricultural adaptations to climate change among rural stakeholders and local decision-makers in Latin America. The study uses a formal priority-setting methodology to generate local response options to climate change in agriculture. The response options address different sources of uncertainty in local agroecosystems stemming from climate changes – principally in temperature, precipitation and the frequency of extreme events – and their expected effects. The application is to three diverse agroecosystems in Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. In each case, local country project teams involved participants in a series of workshops designed to : (i) understand expected climate changes and identify possible response options; (ii) prioritize the response options; and (iii) develop a climate change action plan that addresses agricultural adaptations to climate change. These response options form the basis for a climate change action plan developed in each case. Following a brief background and overview of the study, this report discusses the study objectives, the priority-setting methodology employed, and then provides a short description of each of the three study sites. In the main body of the report, each of the four project steps, centered around a series of three workshops in each country, is outlined and discussed. The concluding section summarizes the results and conclusions of the study, the lessons learned regarding the potential application of this methodology elsewhere, and the possible extensions of this study to other countries and contexts.""RESILIENT: Zero Carbon, Risk-Informed, Sustainable","This report is comprised of 15 country case studies providing examples of climate action, disaster risk reduction and recovery, and sustainable energy. Each case emphasizes the integrated approach to these work streams and similarly, the linkages and benefits that each extends to the others. This report, chronicling efforts since 2015, looks specifically at the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. It reflects on the work supported by UNDP at country and regional levels, and emphasizes how these actions support progress. The report highlights how action areas are interconnected and how progress on one is progress on another, showcasing initiatives such as the use of reforestation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously provide protection against land degradation and sea-level rise; solar projects that enhance energy access while empowering women and students; disaster recovery processes that strengthen infrastructure and institutions against future threats; and how Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the crux of each country’s commitments to the Paris Agreement.""Adapting to climate change : lessons learned, work in progress, and proposed next steps for the World Bank in Latin America","This report presents a brief overview of the work on adaptation to climate change already under-taken by the World Bank in the Latin America region. It also summarizes current initiatives in the portfolio and presents recommendations for further work. The document echoes the conclusion reached in a previous report concerning the priority character of adaptation in Latin America, given the region's reliance on a fragile natural resource base and the irreversible character of many of the anticipated changes. Impacts in the region include coastal-threatening sea level increases, increased sea surface temperatures, catastrophic melting of tropical glaciers and snowcaps, destructive warming of moor-lands and other high altitude ecosystems in the Andes, higher frequency and extension of forest fires, the appearance of tropical disease vectors in the Andes piedmont, changes in agricultural productivity, and impacts on coastal and watershed ecosystems. Known information on these impacts is summarized in the report"The Oasis as a Megacity: Urumqi's Fast Urbanisation in a Semiarid Environment,"Urumqi represents one of the most dynamic examples of urban development of the last 50 years, changing from a traditional Central Asian city of less than 100,000 inhabitants in 1950 to the most important economic growth pole of northwestern China with a population of approximately 4 million people. Due to its location in a narrow semiarid green belt between the glaciated Tianshan Mountains and the vast semi-desert lowlands of the Junggar Basin, water from the surrounding mountains is indispensable to human activities in this area. However, the sharp increase in water demand during the last 50 years has resulted in the usage of approximately 89 % of surface runoff. In addition, nearly 50 % of Urumqi’s water supply is extracted from groundwater resources. This article describes the hydrological system of Urumqi and the water-related challenges that have to be met in the coming years.""Climate-resilient, climate-friendly world heritage cities","While the negative impacts of climate change on urban areas are well-known and widely discussed, its implicit impacts on historic downtowns have not been studied as extensively. In recent years, cultural heritage conservation and valorization have increasingly become drivers of local economic development. Many projects supported by the World Bank in this field help leverage cultural heritage for economic development while developing infrastructure and services for residents and enhancing the livability of cities. The World Bank has also been very active in addressing climate change risks and increasing resiliency of urban areas. This paper is an effort to merge these two critical agendas. The paper investigates the impacts of climate change on 237 world heritage cities (WHC) and provides an overview of the geographic distribution of these cities around the globe. It discusses the importance of historic downtowns and provides various options available to the governments of these cities to address risk mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Further, it provides examples of WHC which have taken action to address vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. This report is organized in following five sections: section one presents an overview of WHC, geographic distribution, and the growth of the urban agglomerations to which they belong. Section two presents the natural hazard risks and climate change impacts facing WHC, their location on the coastline or interior, and their rank in terms of level of vulnerability. Section three outlines the characteristics that historic cities have in terms of carbon emissions and potential for climate change mitigation. Section four discusses the sources of financing which WHC may turn to in order to address climate change mitigation and adaptation. Section five presents the climate change adaptation and mitigation action plans being implemented in the WHC of Paris, Tunis, Edinburgh, Mexico City, Hue, and Quito."Snowmaking and Climate Change: Future Options for Snow Production in Tyrolean Ski Resorts,"Winter tourism is high- ly sensitive to climate change. The suffi- ciently studied altitu- dinally dependent line of natural snow relia- bility is losing its rele- vance for skilift opera- tors in Austria, where 59% of the ski area is covered by artificial snowmaking. But the diffusion of snowmaking facilities cannot be monocausally linked to climate change, as trends in tourism, prestige, and competitive advantage are important factors. Despite the fact that snowmak- ing is limited by climatological factors, skilift operators trust in technical improvements and believe the future will not be as menacing as assumed by recent climate change impact studies. The aim of the present study is to define reasons for the diffusion of snowmaking sys- tems and to determine whether snowmaking can be a viable adaptation strategy despite ongoing warming,using a simple degree-day model. Results obtained withthis method of assessing technical snow reliability show that current snowmaking intensity will not be suf- ficient to guarantee the desired 100-day season at ele- vations below 1500–1600 m. Snowmaking will still be possible climatically even at lower elevations, but the required intensification of capacity will lead to signifi- cantly higher operation costs."Building resilience to climate change: ecosystem-based adaptation and lessons from the fieldÂ ,"With climate change now a certainty, the question is now how much change there will be and what can be done about it. One of the answers is through adaptation. Many of the lessons that are being learned in adaptation are from success stories from the field. This publication contains eleven case studies covering different ecosystems and regions around the world. Its aim is to summarize some current applications of the Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) concept and its tools used around the world, and also draw lessons from experiences in conservation adaptation.""Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in the Tourism Sector: Frameworks, Tools and Practices","With its close connections to the environment and climate itself, tourism is considered to be a vulnerable and highly climate-sensitive economic sector, similar to agriculture, insurance, energy, and transportation. At the same time, tourism is a contributor to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, including emissions from transport, accommodation and activities. In 2005, tourism's contribution to GHG emissions was estimated to be approximately 5%. According to the Davos Declaration on climate Change and Tourism the sector has to 'rapidly respond to climate change, within the evolving UN framework and progressively reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, if it is to grow in a sustainable way'. In response to this challenge this publication is designed to provide a pragmatic platform to strengthen the capacity of professionals to understand and respond effectively to the global challenges of climate change in tourism destinations. It is the result of the ongoing cooperation between UNEP, UNWTO and WMO in the context of the wider UN response to climate change. The publication presents an overview of the current science and policy of climate change, followed by self-guidance material on mitigation and adaptation, exploring tools, methods and techniques associated with the management of climate change in tourism. It also identifies examples of good practice from which stakeholders might learn in order to develop their own capacities for implementing climate change strategies."
