Still, they are among the most disadvantaged regions in the world, with the highest poverty rates and some of the greatest vulnerability to global climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic change and related risks. The existing challenges of and increasing pressure on mountain people and resources enforce unsustainable land management practices and land abandonment, which in turn might imperil the provision of key mountain services. With its new international program Promoting Sustainable Mountain Development for Global Change, Switzerland continues its support for the sustainable mountain development agenda to increase the resilience of mountain populations.Mountains are key contexts for sustainable development because of their provision of indispensable goods and services.

The paper begins with a brief discussion of the methodological and theoretical concept of vulnerability, which framed the research.

The analysis considers irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, water property interests, different productive structures (viticulture, horticulture, etc.), producer typologies (large/small, export, etc.), and geographical location. Finally, the paper offers some insights about development style and adaptive capacities of rural people to overcome those vulnerabilities.",Climate change will increasingly impact large areas of South America affecting important natural resources and people s livelihoods These impacts will make rural people disproportionately more vulnerable given their dependency on ecosystem services and their exposure to other stressors such as new rules imposed by agribusiness and trends toward the commodification of natural resources This paper focuses on the vulnerability of rural communities in Andean drylands of Argentina Bolivia and Chile showing how different economic and political pathways lead to different levels of vulnerability The paper begins with a brief discussion of the methodological and theoretical concept of vulnerability which framed the research Starting from the premise that global environmental change impacts are strongly linked to styles of development the discussion explores the diverse institutional capital and governance schemes as well as different development styles in the case studies and their role in increasing or reducing local vulnerability to climate and water scarcity Using a comparative perspective the exposures and adaptive capacities of rural actors in three river basins are discussed emphasizing situations that speak for the ways in which development styles counteract or magnify conditions of vulnerability The analysis considers irrigated and non irrigated agriculture water property interests different productive structures viticulture horticulture etc producer typologies large small export etc and geographical location Finally the paper offers some insights about development style and adaptive capacities of rural people to overcome those vulnerabilities Development local livelihoods and vulnerabilities to global environmental change in the South American Dry Andes Montana E Pucara Basin Bolivia

It is sensitive to effects caused by global warming, such as glacier retreat and permafrost degradation. Trails and mountain huts form the infrastructure basis for hiking and mountaineering in the Alps. This infrastructure is a decisive factor for summer mountain tourism. This article presents a classification of phenomena describing the effects of global warming on high Alpine trails and routes. The classification was developed based on an in-depth study in the Austrian Alps. The examples collected show that in the context of global warming, numerous different types of phenomena can affect both the occurrence of natural hazards along high Alpine trails and routes, and the accessibility of the terrain. Depending on the specific situation, threats and difficulties can increase or decrease. Trail holders have to adapt the high Alpine trail network to these changes.

Glacial melting has increased since the 1980s, and popular reports often suggest there will be significant impacts on local populations, including migration. Based on interviews with local residents, both migrants and nonmigrants, as well as topical experts, this study suggests that residents do, indeed, have serious concerns about future livelihood conditions in the Bolivian Andes. Even so, glacial retreat has not triggered new migration flows and has had a limited impact on the existing migratory patterns.",This article examines the role of glacial retreat on human migration in the Bolivian Andes a topic with virtually no scholarly focus yet of critical importance in the era of global climate change Glacial melting has increased since the 1980s and popular reports often suggest there will be significant impacts on local populations including migration Based on interviews with local residents both migrants and nonmigrants as well as topical experts this study suggests that residents do indeed have serious concerns about future livelihood conditions in the Bolivian Andes Even so glacial retreat has not triggered new migration flows and has had a limited impact on the existing migratory patterns Can glacial retreat lead to migration A critical discussion of the impact of glacier shrinkage upon population mobility in the Bolivian Andes Raoul K La Paz Bolivia

In the Bolivian Andes, the Chacaltaya glacier (5400 masl) had been a tourist destination known as the highest ski slope in the world since 1939. As a result of climate change, skiing has not been possible after 1987 and the glacier definitely disappeared in 2009. However, since 2005, the place has become a new attraction for tourists. Travel agencies in La Paz now offer day trips to the Chacaltaya site. In order to understand the present attraction of the site and its potential for reproduction elsewhere, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with various categories of stakeholders involved in the tourism industry in La Paz, and archives and images were analysed. Our results show that the multifunctional character of this tourist site, including easy access to a summit, beautiful views, acclimatisation to altitude and opportunity to experience snow, are key factors in its renewed attraction for visitors, together with, to a lesser extent, the incentive of being able to watch a famous and evident full disappearance of a glacier and former ski slope. The stakeholders' groups share general views and perceptions about environmental changes and about the qualities of the site, but they also differ in terms of projects and evaluation of potential attractiveness. In particular, the development of the visibility of climate change impacts on mountain environment is valued by experts or by members of the Andean Club, but not by travel agencies. The example of Chacaltaya shows that multifunctional tourist sites may still be attractive in the future.",Over the last 40 years warmer temperatures have caused a considerable decrease in snow cover on glaciers and high rates of glacial melt particularly in tropical mountains In the Bolivian Andes the Chacaltaya glacier 5400 masl had been a tourist destination known as the highest ski slope in the world since 1939 As a result of climate change skiing has not been possible after 1987 and the glacier definitely disappeared in 2009 However since 2005 the place has become a new attraction for tourists Travel agencies in La Paz now offer day trips to the Chacaltaya site In order to understand the present attraction of the site and its potential for reproduction elsewhere 25 semi structured interviews were conducted with various categories of stakeholders involved in the tourism industry in La Paz and archives and images were analysed Our results show that the multifunctional character of this tourist site including easy access to a summit beautiful views acclimatisation to altitude and opportunity to experience snow are key factors in its renewed attraction for visitors together with to a lesser extent the incentive of being able to watch a famous and evident full disappearance of a glacier and former ski slope The stakeholders groups share general views and perceptions about environmental changes and about the qualities of the site but they also differ in terms of projects and evaluation of potential attractiveness In particular the development of the visibility of climate change impacts on mountain environment is valued by experts or by members of the Andean Club but not by travel agencies The example of Chacaltaya shows that multifunctional tourist sites may still be attractive in the future Climate change adaptation of the tourism sector in the Bolivian Andes Kaenzig R La Paz Bolivia

Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George, in Central British Columbia, Canada, to build on existing work and explore how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other representatives. The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans to explore alternative paving techniques. Outcomes of the case study provide insights regarding climate change and local transportation infrastructure, including: how researchers can engage with local experts to explore adaptation; issues local governments perceive as important; and barriers communities face as they attempt to address vulnerabilities.",Transport infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts as it is designed for long operational lives and both episodic and seasonal conditions contribute to deterioration disruption and unsafe incidents There are some examples of adaptation in transportation design but many communities do not have the capacity to incorporate climate change considerations into infrastructure planning and management Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George in Central British Columbia Canada to build on existing work and explore how the City could plan design and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change A local steering committee was formed and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners researchers consultants and other representatives The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety and plans to explore alternative paving techniques Outcomes of the case study provide insights regarding climate change and local transportation infrastructure including how researchers can engage with local experts to explore adaptation issues local governments perceive as important and barriers communities face as they attempt to address vulnerabilities Climate change adaptation strategies for transportation infrastructure in Prince George Canada Picketts I Prince George Canada

The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes.

Physical processes in the Alps govern the behaviour of the Rhone from its source (Rhone Glacier) to the Lake of Geneva, and substantial changes are expected to occur in the amount and seasonality of precipitation, and in the response of snow and glaciers to a warming climate. As a result, discharge in the alpine part of the Rhone River is likely to undergo an increase in winter and early spring, but strongly decreases from late spring to late autumn. These changes in water regimes will certainly be accompanied by more frequent geomorphic hazards, related to increases in heavy precipitation events and the melting of permanently frozen grounds. The direct and indirect impacts of a warming climate will affect key economic sectors such as tourism, hydropower, and agriculture, while shifts in extreme events will have an impact on the vulnerability of infrastructure and a range of economic sectors and services. Projections of the future course of events can help in advance planning and decision making in order to alleviate some of the more negative consequences of climate and hydrological impacts on key economic sectors in the region. This paper will thus discuss issues related to current and future water governance in the region, whether water-related policies are sufficiently robust today to cope with what may be rapid changes in water availability and water use in coming decades, and to resolve possible rivalries between economic sectors that may be increasingly confronted with problems of water availability at critical times of the year.

Concurrently, the style of water governance in Chile has long been held up by international institutions such as the World Bank as a potential model for other Latin American countries seeking to reform their own water governance frameworks. In light of both these issues, a closer inspection of the Chilean water governance context in relation to its adaptive capacity to climate change is warranted. To this end, a governance-related adaptive capacity assessment was applied to a Chilean river basin, the Aconcagua in Region V that focussed on both short and long term resilience, as well as proactive and reactive capacity. Results show that for the Aconcagua Region, the Chilean water governance regime demonstrates significant challenges in adapting to increasingly recurrent and intense periods of drought. Reactive coping techniques for climate variability can be quickly mobilised through the networks that exist. However, longer term preparations and transformative approaches for meeting the mounting challenges of climate change are blocked by lack of trust and cooperation, lack of agency at regional operational levels and lack of accessible and appropriate information on water resources.

In this study we aimed to generate context-specific knowledge about resilience factors for addressing the impacts of drought, with the expectation that bringing forth experiential knowledge on how impacts were addressed in the past would shed light on what constitutes key resilience factors for practitioners working in urban contexts. The study was carried in three of the largest cities in Chile: Santiago, Concepcion, and Valdivia. The analytical framework consists of urban and regional resilience incorporating transdisciplinary approaches applying the Resilience-Wheel tool, combined with participatory methods for the co-production of knowledge and qualitative content analysis of documents and workshops. Results show that key determinants of building resilience to drought were: improving education and access to information, enhancing preparedness, promoting technology transfer, reinforcing organizational linkages and collaboration, decentralizing governance, and encouraging citizen participation. The Resilience-Wheel was useful for navigating the conceptual complexity and diversity of perspectives inherent among social actors. The transdisciplinary approach allowed us to co-produce key knowledge that can be applied to build resilience in future, through a bottom-up approach that bridges the science-policy interface.",Current debate on the implementation of resilience in addressing climatic impacts calls for more pragmatic means of reducing losses In this study we aimed to generate context specific knowledge about resilience factors for addressing the impacts of drought with the expectation that bringing forth experiential knowledge on how impacts were addressed in the past would shed light on what constitutes key resilience factors for practitioners working in urban contexts The study was carried in three of the largest cities in Chile Santiago Concepcion and Valdivia The analytical framework consists of urban and regional resilience incorporating transdisciplinary approaches applying the Resilience Wheel tool combined with participatory methods for the co production of knowledge and qualitative content analysis of documents and workshops Results show that key determinants of building resilience to drought were improving education and access to information enhancing preparedness promoting technology transfer reinforcing organizational linkages and collaboration decentralizing governance and encouraging citizen participation The Resilience Wheel was useful for navigating the conceptual complexity and diversity of perspectives inherent among social actors The transdisciplinary approach allowed us to co produce key knowledge that can be applied to build resilience in future through a bottom up approach that bridges the science policy interface Unpacking Resilience for Adaptation Incorporating Practitioners Experiences through a Transdisciplinary Approach to the Case of Drought in Chile Aldunce P Santiago Chile

The region, referred to by scientists as the Third Pole, covering 5 million km 2 with an average elevation of &gt;4000m and including more than 100,000km 2 of glaciers, is the most sensitive and readily visible indicator of climate change. The area also demonstrates considerable feedbacks to global environmental changes. The unique interactions among the atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere on the Third Pole ensure permanent flow of Asia's major rivers, thus significantly influencing social and economic development of China, India, Nepal, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bhutan where a fifth of the world's population lives. Like Antarctica and the Arctic, a series of observations and monitoring activities in the Third Pole region have been widely implemented. Yet for a comprehensive understanding of the Third Pole, current observational resources need to be integrated and perfected, and research goals and approaches need to be updated and identified. The Third Pole Environment (TPE) program aims to attract relevant research institutions and academic talents to focus on a theme of 'water-ice-air-ecosystem-human' interactions, to reveal environmental change processes and mechanisms on the Third Pole and their influences on and responses to global changes, and thus to serve for enhancement of human adaptation to the changing environment and realization of human-nature harmony. © 2012.",

Moreover, in many mountain eco nomies, reliable snow cover plays a key role as an important resource for the winter tourism industry, the main income source and driving force of local development in such regions. This study presents a georeferenced agent-based model to analyze the climate change impacts on the ski industry in Andorra and the effect of snowmaking as future adaptation strategy. We project a reduction in ski season length and a drop in the number of skiers, especially in the lowest elevation ski resort of this region. Moreover, this work indicates that snowmaking cannot completely solve the problem of ensuring snow cover at low elevation ski resorts, and should only be considered as a suitable short-term strategy, rather than as a sustainable long-term adaptation strategy.

In this context, mountain regions have been identified as highly vulnerable areas to the effects of climate change and especially interesting areas for the detection and assessment of the potential changes and impacts. Moreover, in the last few decades, winter tourism, highly dependent on weather and snow availability, has become one of the main economic activities and source of local development in many mountain regions around the world.

The aim of the NIVO PYR project, an international research project in the framework of the Working Community of the Pyrenees (CTP), is to analyze the effects of the climate change on the winter tourism, and especially alpine ski tourism, in the Pyrenees. In order to achieve this objective the project intended to joint the current knowledge about the effects of climate change on temperatures, precipitations, snow cover and skiers behavior in the Pyrenees and develop for first time objective and accurate results for this area. To achieve this goal several methods have been used including, historical analysis of climatical series evolution, assessment of different future climate change scenarios for the Pyrenees, modeling future snowpack based on surface energy balance models and agent based modeling for coupling physical and socioeconomic parameters. One of the main results of this project was the identification of different ski resorts profiles depending on their vulnerability to climate change. Three different groups were identified. The first group includes the high vulnerable ski resorts, effected both by a mid and a high-climate change scenario. The second group, includes the low vulnerable ski resorts, affected by a high-climate change scenario but able to be viable with technical adaptation measures in a mid-climate change scenario. Finally, the group of resilient ski resorts includes the geographically and socioeconomically privileged compared to the rest of Pyrenean ski resorts.

To achieve this goal several methods have been used including, historical analysis of climatical series evolution, assessment of different future climate change scenarios for the Pyrenees, modeling future snowpack based on surface energy balance models and agent based modeling for coupling physical and socioeconomic parameters. One of the main results of this project was the identification of different ski resorts profiles depending on their vulnerability to climate change. Three different groups were identified. The first group includes the high vulnerable ski resorts, effected both by a mid and a high-climate change scenario. The second group, includes the low vulnerable ski resorts, affected by a high-climate change scenario but able to be viable with technical adaptation measures in a mid-climate change scenario. Finally, the group of resilient ski resorts includes the geographically and socioeconomically privileged compared to the rest of Pyrenean ski resorts. These ski resorts would be viable both in a mid and a high-climate change scenario just applying technical adaptation strategies. © 2014 CSIC.",In the last decades several studies have demonstrated and given a valuable insight about the existence of a global climate change Even though the existence of a high regional heterogeneity about the level and temporality of climate change impacts the trends of the potential future changes on the temperature and precipitation patterns are better known and consequently the potential impacts on the Biosphere and the Cryosphere In this context mountain regions have been identified as highly vulnerable areas to the effects of climate change and especially interesting areas for the detection and assessment of the potential changes and impacts Moreover in the last few decades winter tourism highly dependent on weather and snow availability has become one of the main economic activities and source of local development in many mountain regions around the world The Pyrenees one of the most important winter tourism areas in Europe after the Alps is a clear example of this pattern The aim of the NIVO PYR project an international research project in the framework of the Working Community of the Pyrenees CTP is to analyze the effects of the climate change on the winter tourism and especially alpine ski tourism in the Pyrenees In order to achieve this objective the project intended to joint the current knowledge about the effects of climate change on temperatures precipitations snow cover and skiers behavior in the Pyrenees and develop for first time objective and accurate results for this area To achieve this goal several methods have been used including historical analysis of climatical series evolution assessment of different future climate change scenarios for the Pyrenees modeling future snowpack based on surface energy balance models and agent based modeling for coupling physical and socioeconomic parameters One of the main results of this project was the identification of different ski resorts profiles depending on their vulnerability to climate change Three different groups were identified The first group includes the high vulnerable ski resorts effected both by a mid and a high climate change scenario The second group includes the low vulnerable ski resorts affected by a high climate change scenario but able to be viable with technical adaptation measures in a mid climate change scenario Finally the group of resilient ski resorts includes the geographically and socioeconomically privileged compared to the rest of Pyrenean ski resorts These ski resorts would be viable both in a mid and a high climate change scenario just applying technical adaptation strategies 2014 CSIC Climate change influence on winter tourism in the Pyrenees Experience from the NIVOPYR research project Pons M Catalan Pyrenees Spain

The RCM results suggest an increase in mean annual temperature, averaged over the Ganges basin, in the range 1-4 degrees C over the period from 2000 to 2050, using the SRES A1B forcing scenario. Projections of precipitation indicate that natural variability dominates the climate change signal and there is considerable uncertainty concerning change in regional annual mean precipitation by 2050. The RCMs do suggest an increase in annual mean precipitation in this region to 2050, but lack significant trend. Glaciers in headwater tributary basins of the Ganges appear to be continuing to decline but it is not clear whether meltwater runoff continues to increase. The predicted changes in precipitation and temperature will probably not lead to significant increase in water availability to 2050, but the timing of runoff from snowmelt will likely occur earlier in spring and summer. Water availability is subject to decadal variability, with much uncertainty in the contribution from climate change. Although global social-economic scenarios show trends to urbanization, locally these trends are less evident and in some districts rural population is increasing. Falling ground-water levels in the Ganges plain may prevent expansion of irrigated areas for food supply. Changes in socio-economic development in combination with projected changes in timing of runoff outside the monsoon period will make difficult choices for water managers. Because of the uncertainty in future water availability trends, decreasing vulnerability by augmenting resilience is the preferred way to adapt to climate change. Adaptive policies are required to increase society's capacity to adapt to both anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Integrated solutions are needed, consistent at various spatial scales, to assure robust and sustainable future use of resources. For water resources this is at the river basin scale. At present adaptation measures in India are planned at national and state level, not taking into account the physical boundaries of water systems. To increase resilience adaptation plans should be made locally specific.

In this context, the massive masonry structures link low-tech, vernacular hydrological thinking with design innovation to create a popular climate-adaptive design solution. While these interventions appear to provide promising new strategies for water harvesting in this dry desert region, very little data exist to substantiate, quantify, or contradict the project claims. This paper interrogates these structures through the lens of the design disciplines and considers the functional aspects of a prototypical artificial glacier system.

Artificial glaciers in the Himalaya illustrate just one of the many innovative landform designs that have recently emerged as a response to climate change challenges. These projects for climate change adaptation represent a new genre of design work that could have considerable implications for the profession of landscape architecture. As cities and towns confront the volatile environmental conditions of the twenty-first century, the broad reach and disciplinary expertise of landscape architecture could provide valuable design thinking around climate change geoengineering, adaptation, and mitigation. However, while large-scale infrastructural projects, such as artificial glaciers, appear to mediate the negative effects of climate change in the short term, these solutions may only provide temporary relief from the larger crisis of a warming planet.",In the face of global climate change radical design proposals present a rare optimistic perspective for future environmental adaptation and ultimately human survival Artificial glaciers in the Himalaya illustrate just one of the many innovative landform designs that have recently emerged as a response to climate change challenges These projects for climate change adaptation represent a new genre of design work that could have considerable implications for the profession of landscape architecture As cities and towns confront the volatile environmental conditions of the twenty first century the broad reach and disciplinary expertise of landscape architecture could provide valuable design thinking around climate change geoengineering adaptation and mitigation However while large scale infrastructural projects such as artificial glaciers appear to mediate the negative effects of climate change in the short term these solutions may only provide temporary relief from the larger crisis of a warming planet Learning from artificial glaciers in the Himalaya design for climate change through low tech infrastructural devices Clouse C Leh India

4383,10.5194/nhess-8-293-2008,Adapting water allocation management to drought scenarios,"Giacomelli, P.",,,,4,2008.0,,Local,Discusses water management from a socioeconomic lens.,"Climate change dynamics have significant consequences on water resources on a watershed scale. With water becoming scarcer and susceptible to variation, the planning and reallocation decisions in watershed management need to be reviewed. This research focuses on an in-depth understanding of the current allocation balance of water resources among competitors, placed along the course of the Adda River. In particular, during the summer period, the demand for water dramatically increases. This is due to the increase in irrigation activities in the lower part of the basin and to the highest peaks of tourist inflow, in the Como Lake and Valtellina areas. Moreover, during these months, the hydroelectric reservoirs in the upper part of the Adda River basin (the Valtellina) retain most of the volume of water coming from the snow and glacier melt. The existing allocation problem among these different competing users is exacerbated by the decreasing water supplies. The summer of 2003 testified the rise in a number of allocation problems and situations of water scarcity that brought about environmental and economical consequences. The RICLIC project is committed to the understanding of water dynamics on a regional scale, to quantify the volumes involved and offer local communities an instrument to improve a sustainable water management system, within uncertain climate change scenarios.",

Water shortages during summer will become more frequent as precipitation is expected to further decrease and glacial meltwater releases will decrease in the long-term due to reduced glacier volume.

In total, 17 companies offered guided glacier activities for approximately 2030,000 visitors per year. Data were collected by repeated interviews, website studies, and participant observation. The product variety covers guided day tours, longer guided tours, and glacier instructor courses. There has been product development from traditional glacier surface walks and activities in the glacier-arm area as well as glacier lake kayaking, terminal face walks, and ice climbing. Glacier tourism can be seen as a mix between purchasable short-term holidays and gradually acquired life-time skill. This analysis focuses on five important preconditions for this adventure tourism niche, namely, natural resources, access, demand, entrepreneurship, and need for special competence. The study also provides insight into current and future challenges and perceived risks on three levels. Results indicate that glacier tourism is not dependent on large glaciers. Studying current companies' location shows there is room for expansion in terms of extensively using natural resources where there is demand. However, some entrepreneurs are sceptical of the industry's future as recent recession of the glaciers has made access more difficult.",This article aims at illuminating the contemporary glacier tourism scene and does so by showing how glacier tourism in Norway has developed as an adventure tourism activity over the past 7 years In total 17 companies offered guided glacier activities for approximately 2030 000 visitors per year Data were collected by repeated interviews website studies and participant observation The product variety covers guided day tours longer guided tours and glacier instructor courses There has been product development from traditional glacier surface walks and activities in the glacier arm area as well as glacier lake kayaking terminal face walks and ice climbing Glacier tourism can be seen as a mix between purchasable short term holidays and gradually acquired life time skill This analysis focuses on five important preconditions for this adventure tourism niche namely natural resources access demand entrepreneurship and need for special competence The study also provides insight into current and future challenges and perceived risks on three levels Results indicate that glacier tourism is not dependent on large glaciers Studying current companies location shows there is room for expansion in terms of extensively using natural resources where there is demand However some entrepreneurs are sceptical of the industry s future as recent recession of the glaciers has made access more difficult Frozen Adventure at Risk A 7 year Follow up Study of Norwegian Glacier Tourism Furunes T Jostedalsbreen National Park Norway

The main focus of this article is to highlight the cultural, social, and economic dependency of the Lama and Dalit ethnic groups and to examine whether processes of adaptation exacerbate or alter gender inequalities and intercaste dependencies.",Despite the growing number of studies and research projects on climate change adaptation only a few have examined the gender and cultural dynamics of the adaptation process Inequality has been identified as a major indicator of the vulnerability of individuals and groups nevertheless the gender and cultural aspects of inequality have not received much emphasis The present article attempts to analyze the influence of gender and cultural relations on the process of climate change adaptation by presenting a study of Dalit and Lama households in the mountainous Humla District of Nepal The inhabitants of Humla have been experiencing a shift in the monsoon season a decrease in snowfall and longer dry periods with adverse effects on their livelihoods The main focus of this article is to highlight the cultural social and economic dependency of the Lama and Dalit ethnic groups and to examine whether processes of adaptation exacerbate or alter gender inequalities and intercaste dependencies The Role of Gender and Caste in Climate Adaptation Strategies in Nepal Emerging Change and Persistent Inequalities in the Far Western Region Onta N Humla Nepal
4427,10.1659/mrd-journal-d-17-00035.1,Seasonal Migration and Livelihood Resilience in the Face of Climate Change in Nepal,"Gautam, Y.","Humla, Nepal",30.0051731,81.9534815,1,2017.0,,Local,Discuss migration as coping strategy to mainly non-climate stressors,"Migration for work remains a livelihood strategy in subsistence farming communities globally, especially in view of unprecedented environmental change. Farmers in the high Himalaya migrate during the winter, when farming activities are reduced. This study examined the drivers of seasonal migration in the context of climate change and migration's role in food security and livelihood resilience in the district of Humla, Nepal. Focus group discussions and a household socioeconomic survey were conducted. The results suggest that rather than climate change impacts, structural poverty is the root cause of migration, such that men from poor households with small landholdings and high food insecurity, mainly belonging to low-caste groups, migrate for work during the winter. Focus group participants also presented a clear perception of climate variability and change and their negative impacts on crop production. In this context, the poorest households find cultivating their own land risky. Moreover, the traditional practice of sharecropping, which helped them reduce food shortages, has also become less profitable. Therefore, more households are likely to participate in seasonal migration in the context of climate change, and those already migrating are likely to do so for longer time periods. Currently, such migrants take up low-paying unskilled wage work, mainly in towns and cities in Uttarakhand, India, which enable them to make only modest savings, hardly enough to repay the debt their family has incurred during food shortages. Even in the future, these farmers are likely to be limited to the same migration pattern, because they lack the social ties, education, and financial capital needed to fulfill the administrative and monetary requirements for more economically promising long-term overseas migration. Thus, it is unlikely that migration will make a significant contribution to building livelihood resilience in the context of climate change in remote Himalayan farming communities.",Migration for work remains a livelihood strategy in subsistence farming communities globally especially in view of unprecedented environmental change Farmers in the high Himalaya migrate during the winter when farming activities are reduced This study examined the drivers of seasonal migration in the context of climate change and migration s role in food security and livelihood resilience in the district of Humla Nepal Focus group discussions and a household socioeconomic survey were conducted The results suggest that rather than climate change impacts structural poverty is the root cause of migration such that men from poor households with small landholdings and high food insecurity mainly belonging to low caste groups migrate for work during the winter Focus group participants also presented a clear perception of climate variability and change and their negative impacts on crop production In this context the poorest households find cultivating their own land risky Moreover the traditional practice of sharecropping which helped them reduce food shortages has also become less profitable Therefore more households are likely to participate in seasonal migration in the context of climate change and those already migrating are likely to do so for longer time periods Currently such migrants take up low paying unskilled wage work mainly in towns and cities in Uttarakhand India which enable them to make only modest savings hardly enough to repay the debt their family has incurred during food shortages Even in the future these farmers are likely to be limited to the same migration pattern because they lack the social ties education and financial capital needed to fulfill the administrative and monetary requirements for more economically promising long term overseas migration Thus it is unlikely that migration will make a significant contribution to building livelihood resilience in the context of climate change in remote Himalayan farming communities Seasonal Migration and Livelihood Resilience in the Face of Climate Change in Nepal Gautam Y Humla Nepal

However, in recent years, the recession of both glaciershas been increasinglyrapidand the impacts on, and implications for, visitor experiences in these settings remain relatively unexplored. A mixed-method approach was adopted to investigate visitor experiences and stakeholder perspectives through an assessment of climate-related changes on tourism at the glaciers in Westland Tai Poutini National Park. The bio-physical conditions at both the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers were reviewed in order to assess the magnitude and rate of retreat. Perceptions of climate change risk and awareness of impacts in the National Park were assessed through stakeholder interviews (n = 13) and a visitor survey (n = 500) was used to better understand how impacts at these sites have affected and may continue to affect visitor experiences. Research results were reported to local communities via a series of public talks.

However, in recent years, the recession of both glaciershas been increasinglyrapidand the impacts on, and implications for, visitor experiences in these settings remain relatively unexplored. A mixed-method approach was adopted to investigate visitor experiences and stakeholder perspectives through an assessment of climate-related changes on tourism at the glaciers in Westland Tai Poutini National Park. The bio-physical conditions at both the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers were reviewed in order to assess the magnitude and rate of retreat. Perceptions of climate change risk and awareness of impacts in the National Park were assessed through stakeholder interviews (n = 13) and a visitor survey (n = 500) was used to better understand how impacts at these sites have affected and may continue to affect visitor experiences. Research results were reported to local communities via a series of public talks. Results revealed the fundamental importance of viewing the glaciers as a significant travel motive of visitors, suggesting that there is a last chance' dimension to their experience.

However, issues of geographic isolation are compounded by major threats of flooding and earthquake, rising fuel prices and climate change scenarios which imply serious glacier melting. Using 24 stakeholder interviews, this study evaluates susceptibility to change at multiple scales which could undermine the economic and social longevity of this iconic destination. Adopting a human-environment systems perspective, it utilises the concepts of vulnerability and resilience to examine dimensions of change and response that have shaped the community, conservation and tourism in this peripheral region.

Effectiveness","Pakistan is one of the most adversely affected countries by climate-related extreme events such as floods owing to its geographical and climatic conditions. Over the last two decades, frequency and severity of flood events have been increased and has adversely affected the livelihood and well-being of millions of people in Pakistan. The development of effective mitigation policies requires a clear understanding of the impacts and local responses to extreme events, which is quite limited in Pakistan. This study used a dataset of 600 households collected through face-to-face interviews from two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that were severely affected from 2010 floods. The correlation and probit model methods are used to assess the study objectives. The findings of the study revealed that elevated ground floor, foundation strengthening, construction of house with reinforced material and precautionary savings were the main adaptation measures adopted at household level. The results from the probit model showed that gender, age, location, monthly income, family size, house ownership, disability, and education influence the households’ choices of mitigation strategies. The study further indicated that adoption of mitigation strategies at household level is constrained by several factors, i.e., financial constraint, lack of early warning system, lack of land use planning and inadequate resources. Further mitigation strategies also varied across different groups of households based on education, age, and income. Additionally the study discovered that the local policies on disaster management need to be improved to address the barriers to the adoption of advanced level adaptation measures at the household level such as advanced level early warning system, flood forecasting and dissemination of updated information and support, house building codes, infrastructure building practices, and adequate spatial planning.",Pakistan is one of the most adversely affected countries by climate related extreme events such as floods owing to its geographical and climatic conditions Over the last two decades frequency and severity of flood events have been increased and has adversely affected the livelihood and well being of millions of people in Pakistan The development of effective mitigation policies requires a clear understanding of the impacts and local responses to extreme events which is quite limited in Pakistan This study used a dataset of 600 households collected through face to face interviews from two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that were severely affected from 2010 floods The correlation and probit model methods are used to assess the study objectives The findings of the study revealed that elevated ground floor foundation strengthening construction of house with reinforced material and precautionary savings were the main adaptation measures adopted at household level The results from the probit model showed that gender age location monthly income family size house ownership disability and education influence the households choices of mitigation strategies The study further indicated that adoption of mitigation strategies at household level is constrained by several factors i e financial constraint lack of early warning system lack of land use planning and inadequate resources Further mitigation strategies also varied across different groups of households based on education age and income Additionally the study discovered that the local policies on disaster management need to be improved to address the barriers to the adoption of advanced level adaptation measures at the household level such as advanced level early warning system flood forecasting and dissemination of updated information and support house building codes infrastructure building practices and adequate spatial planning Determinants of flood risk mitigation strategies at household level a case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KP province Pakistan Shah A Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan

This decade-long struggle culminated in 2008 when a coalition of local groups (stakeholders) from the Cruz de Mayo and Caraz communities in the Callejon de Huaylas seized control of the Lake Paron reservoir from a private multinational corporation, Duke Energy. This clash over Paron's water in the Llullan and Santa River watersheds emerged much earlier than climatic-hydrologic models had predicted, and it occurred, this paper argues, largely because of previously successful climate adaptation measures. The drainage tunnel and floodgates originally installed at Paron in the 1980s to prevent a climate-related outburst flood led to unintended or perverse outcomes because these technological artifacts subsequently allowed a diversity of stakeholders including rural subsistence farmers, urban residents, national park officials, tourism promoters, the state energy company Electroperu, and Duke Energy to manage water differently depending on their priorities and the existing governance structures. Neoliberal reforms that altered state-society-environment relations in Peru played a key role in these changing stakeholder power dynamics that were reflected in the management of water infrastructure at Paron. Examining this water conflict that emerged from the unintended effects of climate adaptation demonstrates not only how technology and society are mutually constitutive, but also why the politics of technologies must be considered more carefully in the analysis of social-ecological systems, hydro-social cycles, and climate change adaptation.

Yet environmental stress and adaptive capacity are distributed unevenly, and power structures play a role in fashioning them. It is argued here that when access to land and water are impacted by environmental stress, the structures that mediate their access are reinforced, even as the adaptive alternatives for smallholders are undermined. In this way, dominant resource regimes set up migration as the primary viable alternative for adaptation among a dwindling set of choices. This framework is applied to two early analogues of climate change impacts: flooded Garifuna villages of Honduras's North Coast and communities enduring glacier recession and shifting hydrologic regimes in Peru's Cordillera Blanca. In both cases, stress motivates new forms of migration that reinforce dominant power structures. In Honduras, migrants from wealthier social strata are moving on a more permanent basis, and in Peru, the once historical pattern of labor migration is becoming a practical necessity. These cases underscore the role of political economy in adaptation to climate change and adaptive migration in particular. ?????????????, ????????????????????, ??????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????, ????????????, ???????????????????, ?????????????????, ?????????????????????????, ?????????????, ???????????????????????????????????????: ?????????????????

Pero el estres ambiental y la capacidad adaptativa se distribuyen desigualmente, y las estructuras de poder juegan un papel importante en su formacion. Aqui se sostiene que cuando el acceso a la tierra y al agua es impactado por estres ambiental, las estructuras que intervienen en su acceso son reforzadas, aun a expensas de las alternativas adaptativas para los pequenos propietarios. De esa manera, los regimenes de recursos dominantes colocan a la migracion como la alternativa viable primaria de adaptacion entre un conjunto de opciones cada vez mas limitado. Este esquema se aplica a dos analogos tempranos impactados por el cambio climatico: aldeas garifunas afectadas por inundacion en la Costa Norte de Honduras y comunidades que padecen cambiantes regimenes hidrologicos en la Cordillera Blanca del Peru por la recesion de glaciares. En ambos casos el estres motiva nuevas formas de migracion que refuerzan las dominantes estructuras de poder. En Honduras, los migrantes de los estratos sociales pudientes se desplazan de una manera mas permanente, y en el Peru, el que en otros tiempos fuera un patron historico de migracion laboral se esta convirtiendo en una necesidad practica.

Despite their longstanding history, many of these ecosystems and the services they provide are currently threatened by a number of economic and environmental factors. We use findings from behavioral science to examine the opportunities and conflicts at different governance levels individual, community, and global. Market pressures to produce for distant markets have resulted in reduced diversity of crops in the Andes region. Another major threat to ecosystem services in the region is climate change, which is already being observed in the form of rising temperatures, extreme temperature fluctuation, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing glacial melt. To explore the effects of, and the responses to, these pressures we used semi-structured interviews to gain insight into agricultural practices and challenges and the various levels of governance present in the agriculture of Langui, Peru. We find that low staple crop prices combined with increasing climate variability has led to a reduced production of traditional crops such as pseudocereals and tubers in favor of production of improved grasses for livestock. The growth of the livestock economy is being driven by the presence of a transnational dairy corporation in the region, plus increased migration leading to a reduced local labor force. We conclude that loss of traditional crops and community based agricultural management techniques will make it difficult for smallholders to maintain food self-sufficiency and agrobiocliversity in the face of a changing climate and global economy.

To adapt to climate changes, local governments need information on the rate of glacier area and volume losses and on current ice thickness. Remote sensing analyses of Coropuna glacier (Peru) delineate an acute glaciated area decline between 1955 and 2008. We tested how volume changes can be estimated with remote sensing and GIS techniques using digital elevation models derived from both topographic maps and satellite images. Ice thickness was measured in 2004 using a Ground Penetrating Radar coupled with a Ground Positioning System during a field expedition. It provided profiles of ice thickness on different slopes, orientations and altitudes. These were used to model the current glacier volume using Geographical Information System and statistical multiple regression techniques. The results revealed a significant glacier volume loss; however the uncertainty is higher than the measured volume loss. We also provided an estimate of the remaining volume. The field study provided the scientific evidence needed by COPASA, a local Peruvian NGO, and GTZ, the German international cooperation agency, in order to alert local governments and communities and guide them in adopting new climate change adaptation policies.",Higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns have induced an acute decrease in Andean glaciers thus leading to additional stress on water supply To adapt to climate changes local governments need information on the rate of glacier area and volume losses and on current ice thickness Remote sensing analyses of Coropuna glacier Peru delineate an acute glaciated area decline between 1955 and 2008 We tested how volume changes can be estimated with remote sensing and GIS techniques using digital elevation models derived from both topographic maps and satellite images Ice thickness was measured in 2004 using a Ground Penetrating Radar coupled with a Ground Positioning System during a field expedition It provided profiles of ice thickness on different slopes orientations and altitudes These were used to model the current glacier volume using Geographical Information System and statistical multiple regression techniques The results revealed a significant glacier volume loss however the uncertainty is higher than the measured volume loss We also provided an estimate of the remaining volume The field study provided the scientific evidence needed by COPASA a local Peruvian NGO and GTZ the German international cooperation agency in order to alert local governments and communities and guide them in adopting new climate change adaptation policies Assessing high altitude glacier thickness volume and area changes using field GIS and remote sensing techniques the case of Nevado Coropuna Peru Peduzzi P Coropuna Peru

Discussion mainly around vulnerabilities.,"Projections of future water shortages in the world's glaciated mountain ranges have grown increasingly dire. Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters, the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited. Yet human water use and demand are vital for long-term adaptation, risk reduction, and resource allocation. Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru's arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water-intensive economic development. Models predict water shortages decades into the future, but conflicts have already arisen in Peru's Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages. Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed. This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions. We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, declining Santa River discharge, and alpine wetland contraction. We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms, including smallholder agriculture, mining, potable water use, hydroelectric power generation, and coastal irrigation. We argue that both ecological change and societal forces will play vital roles in shaping the future of water resources and water governance in the region.",Projections of future water shortages in the world s glaciated mountain ranges have grown increasingly dire Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited Yet human water use and demand are vital for long term adaptation risk reduction and resource allocation Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru s arid Pacific slope where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water intensive economic development Models predict water shortages decades into the future but conflicts have already arisen in Peru s Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca declining Santa River discharge and alpine wetland contraction We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms including smallholder agriculture mining potable water use hydroelectric power generation and coastal irrigation We argue that both ecological change and societal forces will play vital roles in shaping the future of water resources and water governance in the region New Geographies of Water and Climate Change in Peru Coupled Natural and Social Transformations in the Santa River Watershed Bury J Santa River Peru

In recent decades the number and area of lakes have been growing at an accelerating rate due to worldwide glacier shrinkage. In the Russian Caucasus this process is understudied. We present results obtained during a 12-year (1999–2010) continuous field monitoring of the Bashkara proglacial lakes group, which we identified as the place with the highest GLOF risk in the region. Recession of the parent Bashkara Glacier was the main driver of the rapid expansion of the lower Lake Lapa. The upper Lake Bashkara has not been enlarging, but its water level has shown significant inter- and intra-annual fluctuations. The lake outburst probability has increased in recent years, and in 2008 we observed surface overflow over the moraine dam. Taking into account that in the late 1950s lake outbursts at this site led to large-scale glacial debris flows, we have simulated a potential outburst using River and FLO-2D software and carried out hazard zonation. An early warning system has been designed and established at Lake Bashkara, and measures to mitigate risk have been proposed.

Scenario approaches are useful in adaptation planning by putting together projected climate change and socioeconomic trends with broader development needs when identifying associated priorities—and using them to develop appropriate strategies, plans and initiatives. To date, explorative scenario approaches have been largely adopted in adaptation planning. In this paper, we determine the benefits of using normative scenario approaches. They include a process known as “backcasting,” which is particularly useful for areas where adaptation planning and actions are strongly intertwined with development planning, and considerable efforts are needed to improve the well-being of the people living in those areas. We show the relevance of backcasting by presenting three case study applications in the following developing countries: Ghana, Honduras and Tajikistan. The results of these case studies indicate that backcasting has specific relevance for adaptation planning, including capacity building and awareness raising to contextualize information on climate impacts with stakeholders’ development needs. Our results also indicate that the developed scenarios provided benefits in promoting horizontal and vertical integration, thus bringing together diverse sectorial and sub-national priorities—adaptation options can thereby be aligned with these needs. Finally, use of the scenarios advances countries’ participation in national and multi-country adaptation projects by targeting actions that provide multiple benefits.",Climate change adaptation is one of the many development challenges impacting livelihoods in developing countries Scenario approaches are useful in adaptation planning by putting together projected climate change and socioeconomic trends with broader development needs when identifying associated priorities and using them to develop appropriate strategies plans and initiatives To date explorative scenario approaches have been largely adopted in adaptation planning In this paper we determine the benefits of using normative scenario approaches They include a process known as backcasting which is particularly useful for areas where adaptation planning and actions are strongly intertwined with development planning and considerable efforts are needed to improve the well being of the people living in those areas We show the relevance of backcasting by presenting three case study applications in the following developing countries Ghana Honduras and Tajikistan The results of these case studies indicate that backcasting has specific relevance for adaptation planning including capacity building and awareness raising to contextualize information on climate impacts with stakeholders development needs Our results also indicate that the developed scenarios provided benefits in promoting horizontal and vertical integration thus bringing together diverse sectorial and sub national priorities adaptation options can thereby be aligned with these needs Finally use of the scenarios advances countries participation in national and multi country adaptation projects by targeting actions that provide multiple benefits Normative scenario approach a vehicle to connect adaptation planning and development needs in developing countries Bizikova L Tajikistan General Tajikistan

The process exposed a remarkable potential for comprehensive adaptation, including in water harvesting, choice of crops and livestock, environmental enhancement, skills and conflict management. We recommend the approach as a model to promote local collective adaptive capacity development. The case study revealed high risks of massive out-migration from mountain villages if adaptation starts too late: countries with a high proportion of mountain agriculture might see significant losses of agricultural area, a reduction in food production and an increase in conflicts in areas where immigration occurs.",The rapid loss of small glaciers worldwide might result in mountain villages changing from having plenty of water during the growing season to facing a scarcity even in scenarios with adaptation Climate change effects might cause the need for significant changes in rural mountain economies that currently rely on irrigated agriculture pastoralism and labor migration Previous research mainly focuses on geophysical aspects and little is known about the local ability to understand climate change indicators or local collective adaptive capacity A 2010 participatory case study in the Zerafshan Range Tajikistan disclosed a local lack of awareness of climate change and its consequences We present a social learning method based on scenarios and visualization The process exposed a remarkable potential for comprehensive adaptation including in water harvesting choice of crops and livestock environmental enhancement skills and conflict management We recommend the approach as a model to promote local collective adaptive capacity development The case study revealed high risks of massive out migration from mountain villages if adaptation starts too late countries with a high proportion of mountain agriculture might see significant losses of agricultural area a reduction in food production and an increase in conflicts in areas where immigration occurs A participatory method to enhance the collective ability to adapt to rapid glacier loss the case of mountain communities in Tajikistan Christmann S Zerafshan Range Tajikistan

The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement.

For this project we interviewed long-term Denali staff, scientists, subsistence community members, bus drivers, and business owners to assess what types of observations each can contribute, how climate change is impacting each, and what they think the National Park Service should do to adapt. The project shows that each type of long-term observer has different types of observations, but that those who depend more directly on natural resources for their livelihoods have more and different observations than those who do not. These findings suggest that engaging multiple groups of stakeholders who interact with the park in distinct ways adds substantially to the information provided by Denali staff and scientists and offers a broader foundation for adaptation planning.

This paper analyzes the status of knowledge from natural science disciplines and research needs relevant to the national and subnational climate adaptation policies of 1 US state (Washington) and 7 countries (Austria, Bhutan, Colombia, Germany, Nepal, Peru, and Switzerland), in particular the elements of those policies focused on mountain areas. In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments. We highlight how the knowledge embedded in natural science disciplines is not always useful to address complex vulnerabilities in coupled human and natural systems and briefly refer to alternative pathways to adaptation in the form of no-regret, flexible, and adaptive management solutions.

4655,http://10.1007/s11077-012-9168-4,,,,,,,,,,,"An interdisciplinary study was conducted in the Kailash Sacred Landscape region in north-western Nepal, to explore opportunities for, and barriers to, sustainable tourism as an adaptation strategy, not only for reducing community vulnerability to climate change but also as a poverty-alleviation measure. Whilst the primary focus was on interactions between tourism and climate change, the study revealed a highly complex system, with many social, economic, environmental, and institutional drivers involved. In order to bring some clarity and consistency in the exploration of these complex interactions in context, elements of the policy sciences, primarily problem orientation, were utilised. The exploratory nature of the study, including its objectives and intended use, meant that goal clarification and analyses of trends were based on limited available information. Despite these shortcomings, the study was able to elucidate and clarify on important factors to consider in consultation with relevant participants. Diversification of livelihood options as well as preserving local culture were found to be highly valued - both by the local communities that were consulted as well as for those advocating for a tourism experience that is unique to this region. Harmonising these valued outcomes could be achieved by incorporating and legitimising local traditional knowledge. Insights into further collaboration on the issue of valued outcomes would strengthen and support the knowledge base for an appraisal of possible development pathways. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",
4656,https://10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.05.010,,,,,,,,,,,"In recent years, an increasing number of local governments are recognizing the impact of climate change on different urban sectors. This has led many to pursue climate adaptation planning, seeking to achieve preparedness through reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience of populations, assets, and municipal operations. Although cities typically share these common goals, many are electing to pursue different planning approaches. In this paper, we examine three climate adaptation planning approaches in the cities of Quito (Ecuador), Surat (India), and Durban (South Africa) and analyze the trade-offs associated with different planning pathways and different forms of stakeholder involvement. We assess the potentials and limitations of these different approaches, including their implications for enhancing government integration and coordination, promoting participation and adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups, and facilitating overall urban resilience. We find that, in order to gain widespread commitment on adaptation, sustained political leadership from the top, departmental engagement, and continued involvement from a variety of stakeholders are integral to effective decision-making and institutionalization of programs in the long run. When climate adaptation is advanced with a focus on learning, awareness, and capacity building, the process will likely lead to more sustained, legitimate, and comprehensive adaptation plans and policies that enhance the resilience of the most affected urban areas and residents.",

This 5-year research project focused on upstream-downstream links related to water resources in mountains where snow and ice are a major component of the hydrological cycle - and thus extremely vulnerable to climatic change. Contributions to this special issue explore issues of governance in different socio-political contexts (Europe, Chile, Kyrgyzstan), and for environmental and economic sectors that compete for water, such as freshwater ecosystems, agriculture or energy (hydropower).

A certain level of uncertainty has always existed in water resources planning, but the speed and intensity of changes in baseline conditions that climate change embodies might require a shift in perspective. This article draws on both the social and physical science results of the EU-FP7 ACQWA project to better understand the challenges and opportunities for adaptation to climate change impacts on the hydrology of the upper Rhone basin in the Canton Valais, Switzerland. It first presents the results of hydro-climatic change projections downscaled to more temporally and spatially-relevant frames of reference for decision makers. Then, it analyses the current policy and legislative framework within which these changes will take place, according to the policy coherence across different water-relevant frameworks as well as the integration and mainstreaming of climate change. It compares the current policy and legislative frameworks for different aspects of water resources management to the projected impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the upper Rhone basin, in order to examine the appropriateness of the current approach for responding to a changing climatic context. Significant uncertainties pose numerous challenges in the governance context. The study draws on adaptive governance principles, to propose policy actions across different scales of governance to better manage baseline variability as well as more 'unpredictable' uncertainty from climate change impacts.

4660,10.3354/cr01118,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper reports on a project conducted over 4 field seasons in the town of Qeqertarsuaq in West Greenland, identifying and examining vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with community members (n = 132), key informant interviews with policy makers (n = 10), and analysis of secondary sources, we documented changes in sea ice regimes, temperatures, and wind. Vulnerabilities to these changes are primarily associated with hunting and fishing. Constrained access and availability of key wildlife resources and increased harvesting dangers are affecting individuals and households closely linked to the subsistence economy. Adaptations that are being employed combine both reactive and anticipatory interventions autonomously undertaken at an individual and household level, including traveling to new fishing grounds, seeking alternative sources of income when harvesting activities are not possible, preparing for the unexpected, and an increased reliance on boat transport. The role of women in supporting male hunters/fishers, knowledge of environmental conditions, the existence of alternative sources of income, diversity and flexibility in harvesting, and willingness to alter livelihoods, are important factors that underpin adaptive capacity. Institutional constraints, however, are a major impediment to adaptation and have reduced the flexibility which has enabled historic adaptation to changing conditions. While alternative income sources are increasingly important in light of recent stresses, occupational hunters face restrictions on money-earning from non-harvesting activities, and various harvesting quotas fail to reflect recent alterations in species availability with changing climatic conditions. More broadly, hunting regulations have contributed to the erosion of the moral economy of harvesting and have weakened social networks, increasing vulnerability to projected future changes in climate.",

Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate.",

This study reports the results of a methodology for identifying and prioritizing local, stakeholder-driven response options to climate change in agriculture. The approach is based on multi-criteria scoring methods previously applied to research planning and priority-setting in agricultural and natural resource management research, public health, and other areas. The methodology is a sequential approach built around needs assessments by local stakeholders; the incorporation of climate science results; the sharing of these results and climate adaption response options with stakeholders at a series of workshops; stakeholder priority-setting exercises using multi-criteria scoring; and validation with policymakers. The application is to three diverse agroecosystems in Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Among the many findings is that, notwithstanding the wide diversity of agro-ecosystems, there are numerous similarities in the agricultural adaptation responses prioritized by local stakeholders.",
4665,https://10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.11.002,,,,,,,,,,,"Smallholder farmers continuously confront multiple social and environmental stressors that necessitate changes in livelihood strategies to prevent damages and take advantage of new opportunities, or adaptation. Vulnerability, meaning susceptibility to harm, is attributable to social determinants that limit access to assets, leading to greater exposure and sensitivity to stressors and a limited capacity to adapt. Stressors and adaptation are intertwined because stressors deplete resources available for adaptation, while adaptation may erode resources available to respond to future stressors. We present empirical evidence demonstrating the interactions of multiple stressors and adaptations over time through a case study of indigenous farmers in highland Bolivia. We examine how farmers perceive the stress on their livelihoods, their strategies for adapting to these threats, and the influence of past adaptation and exposure on vulnerability under increasing climatic change. We find that vulnerability changes over time as multiple stressors, such as land scarcity and delayed seasonal rainfall, compound, simultaneously reducing access and demanding the expenditure of household assets for adaptation, including natural capital (water and land), human capital (including labor), and financial, physical, and social capital. To reduce vulnerability over time, constraints on access to key resources must be addressed, allowing households the flexibility to reduce their exposure and improve their adaptive capacity to the multiple stressors they confront.",
4666,10.1111/1752-1688.12378,,,,,,,,,,,"The South Saskatchewan River Basin is one of Canada's most threatened watersheds, with water supplies in most subbasins over-allocated. In 2013, stakeholders representing irrigation districts, the environment, and municipalities collaborated with researchers and consultants to explore opportunities to improve the resiliency of the management of the Oldman and South Saskatchewan River subbasins. Streamflow scenarios for 2025-2054 were constructed by the novel approach of regressing historical river flows against indices of large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate oscillations to derive statistical streamflow models, which were then run using projected climate indices from global climate models. The impacts of some of the most extreme scenarios were simulated using the hydrologic mass-balance model Operational Analysis and Simulation of Integrated Systems (OASIS). Based on stakeholder observations, the project participants proposed and evaluated potential risk management and adaption strategies, e.g., modifying existing infrastructure, building new infrastructure, changing operations to supplement environmental flows, reducing demand, and sharing supply. The OASIS model was applied interactively at live modeling sessions with stakeholders to explore practical adaptation strategies. Our results, which serve as recommendations for policy makers, showed that forecast-based rationing together with new expanded storage could dramatically reduce water shortages.",
